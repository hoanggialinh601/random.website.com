<h2>09/02/25</h2>
<p>To be back again … at the swaddles of intimacy.</p>
<p>You felt the soft caress, the laughter, the messy rustles of hair … The Ultimate Person was right beside you. It was warm, orange and yellow danced around your figures … You could feel their sharp collarbone, and their small waist nestled comfortably in your arms, as they looked back at you, giggling. “It tickles,” their eyes seemed to smile at you.</p>
<p>You could not get over how warm, and sweet, and personal the moment was. It was just the two of you. You did not know how you got there, but the sweet touches of their breaths and their gorgeously lopsided smiles were enough to compensate for all the pains. Their skin brushed against your own. Their bare chest lay there, haphazardly covered by the blanket you two were under, only out of reach because they decided to turn their back on you. Like a little joke. Truly an effective way to get you to wish for more, to yearn in an almost animalistic desire, as your hands itched for soft skin. Whatever your heart craved for. The reward was tantalising, and so close, yet so far away, hung above your head, mocking.</p>
<p>And here you were again.</p>
<p>It was dark now. The time, space, location … did not matter. You presumed you were on a train, it certainly looked like so. You did not recall how you got here, either, but the other was underneath you, breathing heavily onto your bare chest. You could see them blushing intensely over the position of the two of you, and your situation. Ah. How did you get here?</p>
<p>“You insist …?” The woman whispered, flinching a little as your hair brushed against her neck. Ignoring her silent whimpers, you bent down and began taking off her undershirt, her deflated breasts cradled in your rough, slightly bloodied fingers.</p>
<p>You decided not to reply. Your head still bowed low, you slithered down, one finger caressing her figure, stopping at her large, bloated, white belly with the remnants of stretch marks and imprints of tight waistbands. Her clothing had left numerous dark marks, similar to bruises, a subtle reminder to her of how … undesirable she had become. You could feel her shiver, and the goosebumps. The weather was not too cold, and no wind had passed your vicinity … she was probably scared. Like she should be.</p>
<p>Your finger circled her belly. You made a point to delay a little bit, although you could feel her body whimpering, and her legs subconsciously shifting and moving apart. With how close your face was to her undergarments, you could sense her getting humid over the touch. You poked the watery belly a few times, a little gift left behind from her birth of your brother several years back. Ah.</p>
<p>She decided it was time to moan. The old, cowardly noise echoed the damp air, purple and ultraviolet, ultramarine blue, lapis lazuli. In the vicinity, she was the damp, cold piece of raw, white meat. Inedible. You could see the stars if you creaked your head upwards a little.</p>
<p>Your finger ghosted over the black lace. You could already feel the heat, and another moan from above begged you to unwrap her quickly. Hahah… how impatient. She would have to wait.</p>
<p>You have seen this piece of undergarment before, when you were folding her clothes and helping your other parent do the laundry.</p>
<p>After you examined the lace for another few seconds, your finger made contact with the rough hair, and your nail scratched her smooth, red skin as you slowly pried the piece of cloth off her hips. She shifted a little, her leg sliding apart a little more, another light moan escaping her lips. Your hands now sliding under her torso, you leaned forward, letting your hips crash against her own. As your nipples made contact with hers, you moved yourself back and forth, as your eyes concentrated heavily on the older woman, her flushed red face and plump lips.</p>
<p>“Mpmph …” The noise escaped her throat as your mouth clawed over hers, your tongue exploring the vicinity of her teeth a little too harshly. Your hands have now made their way to her head and neck, and you could feel her sweat, damp on your fingers, stinging the flesh wounds on your cuticles. “Ah.”</p>
<p>You let go of one hand and slowly hoisted her up a little bit. She was a little too heavy for your preferences.</p>
<p>The other hand found its way to her torso, and her lower body, which was still shifting from impatience. As you let go of her, and drew your attention to the area, you could already see the precum leak, almost desperately.</p>
<p style="line-height:5px;margin-right:200px">XXxxxxxxxxxxxxxSDAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXAsxXxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXsxajkn<span style="color:#000000">_______________________________________________________________________________________</span>asakjdbnaskjnxkjnaskjdbnkabndjkandkjasdnjksafbdkjnxknakjg[oewrpqiwvuop4ieph3\irhug=-woreqpw9tioreptewjgilruhg9wq-h\</p>
<p>Would it be nice to ask for something raw, and real, and intimate? <s>To know that all was just a dream.</s></p>
<p>To know that things would just be the same, over and over again … You are tired of <s>torturing</s> helping yourself for so long. A bit of company would help. Not as if you do not have any, but your feelings never seem to come across properly to them. You are tired of constantly sending signals repeatedly. You desperately wished to let them enter your personal life, but some part of you wanted to conserve dignity, the sense of ownership, that you have a life to own. That you have control. It is sad, honestly.</p>
<p>There you were again, rat face. Staring at the Ultimate Person. You had to leave today. It needed to happen. Ah, to let go. To let go. Of all the happiness, the warmth and the yellow, mellow walks down an unknown street, love overflowing so deep,</p>
<p>You release your leash <span style="text-align:right">and they leave to the other side</span></p>
<p>You let your dream go and face reality,</p>
<p>only illusory</p>
<p lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">You cannot eat. You cannot sleep. You cannot face it. You, you cannot stop hurting. Your heart hurts, your chest hurts. You cannot cry, empty husk. You are about to leave. Leave, to another 世界</p>
<p>Other side</p>

<p><sup>because it didn</sup>;<sup>t matter</sup></p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>To be fair, you have always been confused about your very own identity. You felt like living in somebody else’s life, in a second person perspective. You live in a “she”, a “he”, narrating your actions in the third person, constructing up narratives for yourself. You can very well be manipulating yourself to the path of self-pity, and you would have absolutely no idea.</p>
<p>You have always lived under many names. “XXX”, “XXXX”, whatever the situation demanded of your persona. You could switch from giddy and excited to quiet and timid at the drop of a hat. You could be awkward and hilarious with your dry humour, and you could be respectful and composed, depending on the person speaking to you. It is not a skill, and certainly not one to be proud of, but you take pride in it nonetheless. As if others do not have the same skill as you do. As if you are unique.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Talent &#9647;</b></p>
<br>
<p>It has become harder and harder to justify your existence.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you find yourself back at the same spot, wondering whether there was any point in continuing on to the next step. With the hustle and bustle of life, you sweep the thought aside and pour your complete attention to whatever piece of work that is waiting at your desk at the moment. You continue with your packed schedule and everything else took second priority. However, when you are alone, you find yourself backtracking to where you left off.</p>
<p>When you were little, you were considered the odd one out. You were one of the little, childish members of the class who were self-centered and emotionally sensitive. Your name, your desk, whatever space you occupied always came along with a radioactive warning sign. You barely had any friends, and even if you did, your friendships did not tend to last long before breaking for one reason or another. Maybe you lied about something and your friends felt betrayed. Maybe you made them angry and did not know how to apologise. You always ended up on your own in the end. You once tried your best to initiate conversation, to make friends, but your insistent obsession with your own interests chased other children away. You were a particularly stubborn breed of human being.</p>
<p>At some point, you have come to the conclusion that you had not yet mastered the skill of pleasing others. You started to backtrack a bit. You spoke a little less, let others do their own thing, make their own choices. You chose to slow down, to walk behind so others would have the chance to lead. You were “making amends”, and you thought you would be more successful in making some new friends. You have always wanted friends. During your childhood, you have watched endless shows about the power of friendship, the importance of working together, and you have wanted that too. Being popular had always been a desirable thing, as the popular children had always got things going their way. Teachers looked in their direction and gave them opportunities. They had friends who love them and are willing to talk about whatever that interests them. They never had to worry about being alone.</p>
<p>You were living in your own bubble, creating your own worlds. The bathroom was your place of inspiration, the place where you would say everything out loud, let your brain do the painting and constructing. Characters became humans who interacted with other characters, with backstories, narratives, motives. You were never in those worlds - you had always been the spectator - but seeing your characters act out seemingly infinite amounts of colourful stories, that was enough to make you feel satisfied. One day, your character would be out at war. Another day, another one of your characters would be pregnant. And another day, one of your characters would be grieving the death of their family members. Maybe one of them found a new love. Another person probably got an invitation to one of the most prestigious schools in the city, and maybe they would be one step closer to stopping the ultimate villain from murdering their entire bloodline. You had got endless ideas in your arsenal, and enough time to execute them. You were building your world when your mother was carrying you around in her motorcycle, when you were showering, when you were home alone. You started to learn how to “extend” your limbs using your head, as you call it, using subtle head movements to signify dances, jumps, extension and withdrawal of appendages. You learnt how to lip-sync, you learnt how to converse in your own head, how to narrate. <i>"Stop it!" She finally mustered the courage to speak. "Arguing would do you all no good." "Who are you to say, when you are not contributing at all?" The other one next to her yelled back.</i> Finally, you could have some semblance of company, although you still had no words of dialogue. The songs you listened to became soundtracks for scenes, battle sequences, moments of grief, longing, love, shock, happiness, excitement. You were quiet in the company of real people, but when you were left to your own devices, you could speak to yourself for hours. People branded you as the weird child, but it barely mattered to you. You were finally able to move on with your life.</p>
<p>When you grew up a little more and reached puberty, the nature of your world started to change. You started to exert your own self, and the world itself also had more aspects of real life peppered into it. You were imagining what it would be like to act on your crush, to be admired and respected by all members of your class, to be popular and pretty. You were acting out scenes of people swooning over your image, satisfying your weak but big ego. A little self-indulgence would not hurt, you would say. After all, those ideal scenarios were also balanced out by imaginary situations where your parents would kick you out of the house for real, where you would decide to jump down from the highest floor of your school building, drown yourself in the nearby lake, where you would be abandoned by everyone, where you would cry your little tears out and beg and hopefully see a hero for your itsy bitsy teeny tiny little problems. Self-pity at its finest. Inflating your ego. And when life would come back and hit you with the real abandonment, with the real insults and the real pain, you would find yourself only able to squirm uncomfortably in your own shell, unable to coax the pain away. When your mother scolded you for being overweight, you could only cry and squeal, being unable to compose yourself with any suitable response. When nobody paid attention to your hard work and your prizes and awards, you could only look at the rightfully popular and talented children with jealousy. You wondered what your talent was, whether you were worth what you got. Then the truth hit you:</p>
<p>you were more ordinary than you thought</p>
<br>
<p>You eventually lost all idea of how to evaluate yourself. You could only eyeball it, rely on the opinions of others to gauge and adjust your conduct, because the mounds of feedback you were giving yourself were no longer perceived to be trustworthy. Were you exerting enough weight? Were you exerting too much? You cannot tell. People around you have a tendency to procrastinate, but if you step out of line and nag too much, they will probably hate you in the end … You do not want to be hated, you have known what that felt like for the longest time of your life. You have been bullied and you have bullied, and you would do everything in your power to prevent that from happening ever again. However, you could not see where to draw the line. Every part of your life seemed like a blur. Your teacher would encourage you to spill the beans, and yet, there was… <i>nothing to spill</i>. What is wrong with you? No clue. What were you worried about? You do not know. Maybe, you were hiding it from yourself, but at this point you decided not to trust any of your judgement. Your self-awareness murdered all of your self-trust, but perhaps it was for a good reason. You do not know. You do not know. You do not want to know. People told you to enforce self-discipline, draw your own boundaries, but you have no idea how - how not to be hated. No one taught you that.</p>
<p>Maybe, you could just carry on with being a shapeshifter, being a people-pleaser, morph with the changing times. You would probably be accused for lacking a spine, but what is the point of caring about such accusations? Your life has been worthless enough as it is, and dwelling on your <i>worthlessness</i> does not do anyone any favours.</p>
<p>Another year into the draining emptiness of work, it was. You went in, full dive, six feet underneath. Minutes on the computer writing a report became hours and hours. Not feeling hungry, you continued on typing every single black word, font size eight, on and on and on for pages and pages. Your eyes ached for a break, your brain ached for sleep. Your right eye hurt from a tension headache - or at least that was what Google told you. Your throat would constrict at times, each outburst for over 30 minutes or even an hour, just as how it would feel like to have one’s throat squeezed, out of breath. At times, you would stay up until 2 AM, writing about the economy or the social situation of whatever society you were researching on at the moment, although the bright lights around you would incorrectly suggest that it might still have been 8 PM. Writing, writing, writing … deleting paragraph after paragraph, rephrasing sentence after sentence, reformatting word after word, as your brain was as mushy as a pile of sludge. “Welcome to the witching hour,” your computer informed you. You would reluctantly go to bed, as you have school tomorrow. You set your alarm: 5:45 AM. You were only able to go on day by day because of your regular 10 minute naps at school - if it were not for them, your brain might very well have been boiled.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a peaceful afternoon, after school. You and your friends were walking around, hanging out around the school grounds, which was remarkably clear of people and crowds. At times, the three of you would make your way to the nearby street, where some of your classmates stood eating street food: kimbap and chicken, the usual items. However, the peaceful atmosphere was not to be, as in an hour or so, the rest of the student body would be pouring out in droves, ants without a nest, swarming the streets.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can go back to take some ice cream?” Your friend continued to hold onto your arm, swinging it back and forth in an act of nagging.</p>
<p>“I can try …” You murmured reluctantly. They looked insistent, and you did not dare say no. However, deep inside, you feel a sense of discomfort squirming in the depths of your stomach. “Hopefully, with some luck.”</p>
<p>“Please, I’m hungry,” your friend insisted. Your other friend stared at both of you. The constant staring made you feel scrutinised.</p>
<p>“But my parents …”</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell them that you’re going out to take the trash?” The friend holding your hand continued their act of nagging. Biting your lip anxiously, you tried your best to stand your ground, but your friend’s puppy eyes stared right back at you, threatening to melt your heart. It was with no luck …</p>
<p>“OK, I’ll be back in a minute.” You sighed, the monster in your gut uncomfortably rising from its den. Your heart dropped into your intestines.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It was with a few minutes later, that you were back again from your exploits.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I couldn’t take any ice cream, my parents were at the fridge,” you hurriedly apologised. “Although I think you could do with some seaweed.”</p>
<p>The one nagging earlier raised an eyebrow. “It’s really good,” you added quickly.</p>
<p>“... Uh, sure,” they looked unconvinced. Nonetheless, they took a leaf, and began munching. Your other friend followed suit. The three of you stood awkwardly in the middle of the street, eating packaged seaweed. The crowd of students had begun their way out, with all their hustle and bustle, and you could not feel any more awkward.</p>
<p>You stared around. Most of your classmates have left for their extra classes or for their homes. Although the crowd had started to thicken, the street your lot was standing on was largely deserted, with the occasional person passing by being mostly strangers. The quiet atmosphere only added to your silent anxiety as you held on to the oily packet of seaweed on your fingers - you were well aware of how strict your parents were. You took one leaf and began eating slowly to calm yourself down; however, your eyes were darting around repeatedly like a scanner.</p>
<p>After looking around for almost forever, you suddenly came across a particularly surprising find: <i>the person</i>, walking around with their friend, deep in conversation. As if excited by an electric shock, your heart quickened its pace as you almost audibly gasped - you were under the assumption that they had already left. You watched as they paced slowly, their head slightly bowed down deep in thought. Giddy from the happiness that you were wrong, you found your eyes automatically directed towards them, and their tall, slender figure - you could not help it. They were so beautiful, even from afar.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s Y, huh? You were staring."</p>
<p>The accusation made your neck snap back into position, your ears now probably a shade of bright pink. Oh fuck.</p>
<p>“Uh …”</p>
<p>“Have you considered inviting Y to have some seaweed?” One of your nearby classmates suddenly chirped in. “You could do that.”</p>
<p>You stared back at them. “Wait, what?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can,” your friend, still munching on another seaweed leaf, chimed in.</p>
<p>“Uh …” The direction of conversation was too much to your disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Come on, get some courage,” your other friend, who was spectating the entire time the two of you exchanged back and forth about seaweed and ice cream, patted your shoulder lightly. “Come on.”</p>
<p>“You can do it.” The one who suggested the idea smiled at you expectantly.</p>
<p>“Wait what, no,” you shook your head vigorously.</p>
<p>“Come on!”</p>
<p>“Wait no-”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>You found yourself, 5 meters away from the Ultimate Person, still clutching the box of seaweed like how one would clutch a lifeline. Your heart was pounding in your chest, your arteries threatening to burst. Oh my god. My god. My god. My god.</p>
<p>“Do it,” both of your friends snared at you and gave you a strong push.</p>
<p>My god.</p>
<p>“Uh, do you want some seaweed?”</p>
<p>Shit, here it comes.</p>
<p>They simply stared at you.</p>
<p>“Thanks, but you can eat it,” their friend politely answered for them.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p><b>Please accept the fact that you will never amount to anything</b></p>

<h2>13/01/25</h2>
<p>wwwwwww</p>
<p>You have your wall clock to keep you (reluctant) company. You have a few hours of solitude before the next person demands your complete attention. Where you are right now does not matter very much at this moment.</p>
<p>You are suddenly reminded of the day when you waited for your father to come back home from work, late at night. He said he wanted to talk to you about something. The day before, you had witnessed bitter fights between your parents - the kind of fight that required a moderator to intervene. You were wondering whether he would be scolding you for not exerting enough weight then. The anxiety was enough to tie your intestines into dozens of knots, but a little burst of bravery kept you waiting. Time seemed a too sluggish at that moment.</p>
<p>Which was what reminded present-day you of the memory in the first place.</p>
<p>Time is usually interpreted to be absolute. However, you tend to find Einstein's assertion a bit more correct to reality: "time is relative to one's frame of reference".</p>
<p>When you were little, you used to do something you would call "mind-time manipulation". When you would want time to slow down, you would instead channel impatient thoughts begging the clock to tick a little faster. Maybe you would also remind yourself of your boredom, and how desperately you wanted your school year to end - with some regulation, of course, to prevent you from sinking into negativity. The method would work miracles.</p>
<p>At this moment, you would want time to speed up, for the day to end already. End. End. End.</p>
<p>Yet, you wonder whether you can face your ending once it comes. Whether you are ready enough. Would you just spoil everything, similar to what you have been doing your entire miserable life? Probably. But as a subjective observer, you are not one to come up with definitive conclusions.</p>
<p>You wonder what you are fighting for now, when there is almost no purpose in continuing to drag on. You make excuses for yourself, as the coward that you are: you are doing it for your parents. So their investment would not go to waste. You cannot bear watching people grieve over your passing. Et cetera, until you are too scared to let the knife touch your wrist, your heart thumping in choruses of <i>no, no, no, no, no</i></p>
<p>No matter how much practice you have had with dealing with your own blood, you would not dare to end it all. How many billions of dong have been wasted on your education? And you sit here and wonder whether you should stop. Maybe the assertions of your lack of gratitude were not so wrong, after all.</p>
<p>Your school year starts in eight days, you wonder whether you will be able to catch up. The question was no longer "can I obtain passing grades for next year?", but rather "can I obtain enough opportunities for my future portfolio?". Any A+ or As or whatnot are simply tools for you to be the next teacher's pet, to obtain the next invitation for whatever event your tutors find fit. Conversations, talks, group projects are simply means to reach newer heights, gain a better reputation. You are well aware of how uneventful, how automatic your life has become. Weighted Assessment 1, then Weighted Assessment 2, Weighted Assessment 3, End of Year examinations, all put on repeat. Even the days themselves became repetitive - you wake up at 5:45, walk the 15 minute distance to the train station (while munching on breakfast), take the yellow line train, change to blue line, then walk the few ten meters to your school, followed by classes at 8, breaks in the library or cafeteria, lunch, classes, then another journey back home. You are usually left with a pounding tiredness, the constant (unfulfillable) demands for a break. Maybe along the week you would have co curricular activities, i.e. you following instructions to a T without saying any unnecessary statements.</p>
<p>You find yourself losing interest in your hobbies, if you could call them that. Drawing? No, you have no ideas. Writing? No, you have no ideas either. Reading? You cannot, no amount of submersion into the next world could satisfy you these days. In fact, you have no idea what you want. You could only work. The next assignment, the next group project, they became your new routine. Before you knew it, you were absorbed into your studies, finding solutions and answering questions. They left you feeling drained, yes. But at least you were continuing on. Going along with the boredom and the silence. Deep down, you do not know what you were doing. What the point was.</p>
<p>You hear your parents talk. You thought your family was doing okay without you. For a while, you have been plagued by the belief that you were poisoning your own household. With you now gone for over months on end, your sibling seems to be growing up just fine. Your mother has already obtained what you can see (albeit with a blind eye) as a stable job. Your father was managing on with his usual routine, all the while teaching your sibling and continuing on with his hobbies of photo editing. A tech enthusiast, he was, and he would sometimes teach you about basic computer hardware and software. At times, he would show you some new cables, a fancy mouse, some new devices he bought over the Net, with excitement akin to a kindergartener, mind - the genuine excitement always managed to give some warmth to your chest. He seemed to be interested in generative AI, and although you are not in favour of such technology, he still managed to draw you in with his giddiness.</p>
<p>There were days where you were kicked out of your own home. You would walk aimlessly under the sodium yellow lights decorating the streets. Your walks usually lacked direction - left or right, it didn’t matter. Forward you strided, the sky still a tainted light blue. You would listen to music, click random buttons on your brick phone, anything to occupy yourself for the time being. The reason you were out was often quite simple: you stayed back at school too often, or you caused your sibling an accident, or you refused to listen to some of your parents’ instructions. Something like that.</p>
<p>Once, you heard your parents talking in the dead of night. You were not supposed to be there, obviously not. You were usually a heavy sleeper, but that day you were strangely awakened by an unknown force. You were standing by the thin wooden door leading to your parents’ lair, your heart pounding in your chest. The entire house was coated in black, with the only faint whisps of light coming from the room you were looking into.</p>
<p>Your parents were conversing in whispers. Divorce, you heard. Then “I want to keep the family together”. The next thing you heard was “you are too much a terrible father for my children”. Your father, at some point, was already raising his voice in anger, making your ears twitch slightly - your sibling was in bed, less than 50 centimetres away from where they were. You figured you were probably overstepping some boundaries, and you sneaked back to your mattress-bed. You tried to sleep, but to no avail. The presence of noise, although bare, did not help your case.</p>
<p>At some point, your curiosity took the better of you, and you found yourself clutching the thin wooden door again. You can no longer recall what they said at that specific moment, but you remembered sneaking back to bed before one of your parents stood up. In absolute fear, you raced back to bed and got the blanket on. Oh my fucking god.</p>
<p>Through your heavy eyelids, you could see all the lights being turned on in a feverish rage. Then they were off again. You heard noises from the kitchen, vague clunking from the bottom drawer where all the knives were. You heard footsteps You did not remember what happened next</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Courier New'">Your mother still blamed you for not protecting her that day</p>
<br>
<p>Your family had always been somewhat unstable. Your parents had never once owned actual land property, leaving the family to the mercy of landlords. Not to mention, your school fees, tuition, clothes, nutrition, sustenance; along with that comes the question of your mother’s employment. There were months where your unemployed mother would be looming over you at home, the reason for such a situation never being any stranger: she was not satisfied with the offers she usually got. Meanwhile, your father had worked for the same company for over a decade, albeit with no promotion and a salary too low to maintain the family’s current socioeconomic status. What that entailed: your mother’s clothes and jewelry, your clothes and education, your family’s regularly maintained delicious meals and appliances. Attempts to emerge from the middle class. Non-jeopardized happiness.</p>
<p>Constantly struggling, unsatisfied, driven off the edge, <b>despair</b></p>

<h2>25/12/24</h2>
<p>Your sibling had just been scolded, your head hurt from where they had hit you. Typical family event. You are picking up their toys, cleaning up their messes, because as the <i>diligent older sibling</i> you are, it is your responsibility to do those little things when your parents are too tired of their antics to do any chores.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this was the first time you have felt so disappointed in your sibling. They had just done typical child things, after all. If you can call telling the neighbour to "shut up" during a visit or slapping your Dad typical. But to be fair, your standards have always been warped in some way. Your parents told you to go light on them since they are smaller than you are, but after events like these, you have found it harder to determine what to expect.</p>
<p>You could always put expectations at <i>rock bottom</i>, of course, but as a person your sibling looks up to, you should be setting some bar for them to follow and learn. Manners matter in life, after all. People would like you better if you are charming and slick.</p>
<p>You should probably start cleaning.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>You started folding the mountain of jackets, sweaters, socks and whatnot on your sofa. Your parents are rather busy, so they probably would not have time to sit and comb through every garment every time your sibling, or anyone else, decided to dig the pile up a bit to find some obscure cap or socks. You would rather drown yourself in your living room's worth of chores, after all. Doing so makes you feel a bit more <i>useful</i>.</p>
<p>With the lack of human presence, you would probably have been constructing some random scenario for your entertainment if today was any other average Tuesday. Or you could be humming some song with pitch so absurd your hum sounds more deranged than a goat's screech. Maybe you could accompany your journey-to-a-pocket-dimension experience with some acting, your lines obviously mouthed to maintain the silence. However, today was <i>Sunday</i>, and your brain perhaps felt more content dangling you in whatever sludge worth of feelings that it could construct - silent hums with the slow and dreary accompaniment of the constant ticking noise your wall clock was making. As if the wretched clock was inviting you to some sing-along.</p>
<p>In the midst of sorting the clothes, and panicking about how much you would have to do, you made the absolutely horrible mistake, of picking your Dad's jacket up. You were just planning to throw it to the side for a minute, but being the strange human being you are, you find yourself near the brink of tears.</p>
<p>Huh. <i>Misplaced oversensitivity</i>, said the only rational part of your brain.</p>
<p>Well, what was the last time you had seen this family happy?</p>
<p>And the sentence might as well have broken the dam on Yangtze River, because you are practically swimming in thought now. To say you <i>were never happy at all</i> would be a sad exaggeration, you were laughing your sanity out just this afternoon, and your sibling had hardly failed in making absolutely hilarious requests that tickle your little funny bone. And you were not feeling <i>nothing</i>, certainly not bored - there was nothing a little bit of studying could not fix. Perhaps you were upset. There were voices raised, after all. Certainly not out of the ordinary for your family, but you were rather out of element these past few weeks, so you could be a tad bit more forgiving with yourself. It is almost Christmas anyway, you could afford to be more easygoing for the sake of holiday spirit.</p>
<p>You just felt a bit tired with all the patching up you have to do, probably, all the cleaning up, the "shush" and the "hush", the screams of</p>
<p>"keep calm and move the fuck on."</p>
<p>Wholehearted self-restraint, one would call it, all for the sake of keeping the peace, holding the curtains steady. You were not seeing any bombshells, nor any flammable material, but the smell of red in the air was enough to send you up the wall. It only takes a single sentence, one button, for the Demon Core to evolve into a mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>You would have to fix your radar later. It went a little haywire. Surely the silence does not always mean anger?</p>
<p>The floorboards creaked behind you, the air heavy on your chest. You did not have to take a glance to know it was your Dad. Away he went, to the secluded window in the kitchen, checking the dish storage rack  and the pots on the kitchen counter filled with carefully cooked chicken or fish. A few minutes later, as the quiet resumed, you could already smell the bitter tobacco making its way into the crevices of your nasal cavity.</p>
<p>Well, you have given up on warning him about the potential risk of getting lung diseases. BoD.</p>
<p>&#x2605;&#24417;</p>
<p>Pressing down the last puffy jacket onto the tall stack of clothes sitting on the sofa corner, you turned to the miscellaneous items feigning benign on the family piano: files, papers, a roll of tape and a definitely-not-pig-shaped piggy bank that your sibling got for Christmas.</p>
<p>A new dilemma: the ceramic piggy bank, in all its miserable glory, was too fat to be put on top of the fridge or the clothes dryer - usual places to put stuff out of your sibling's reach. Worse, it should be cleared right away since your Dad was not particularly fond of putting anything on the precious piano. Unclear of what to do with the yellow thing, you fumbled around hilariously, timidly walking to the sofa and the humongous pile full of your Mom's possessions, before settling on a small corner atop a stack of carton boxes next to the piano. It was uncomfortably small, but the objects surrounding the corner made ample coverage.</p>
<p>Clearing out some of your sibling's playthings out of the way, you scrambled and repositioned yourself to maintain balance.</p>
<p>___________________</p>
<p>The high-pitched bong the ceramic item made with the piano body made every single one of your cells screech in horror. Your Dad was, to your dismay, still smoking near the kitchen window nearby - with all the thinking power your brain could muster in 1.5 seconds, you raised a shaky hand to muffle the vibrations the wooden piano was making. As if that would help.</p>
<p>Your Dad was still smoking. Thank goodness.</p>
<p>&#9834;</p>
<p>Gingerly, you moved on to the items atop the living room clothes drawer. There was lipstick, eyeshadow, tubes with all sorts of cream you did not bother knowing. Absurdly out of place was the globe your parents bought you back from elementary school, along with a torn yellow package that contained a brand new purse - presumably your Mom's. You were paid too little for cleaning all of this - screw that, you were not even paid. Nevertheless, you settled on the task anyway, as the <i>responsible child</i> you should be.</p>
<p>After reassembling the items a bit, your eyes scanned through a little macaron container holding blue - or rather, what used to be blue - paper roses. If your memory was not lying, you must have made them yourself two years ago. You picked the container up, looking through it for a split second before putting it down onto a nearby counter, as memories associated with the faded blue colour began to swirl.</p>
<p>You continued your cleaning job, stuffing papers randomly into the top drawer. At some point you would stumble on documents with your sibling's name on it, envelopes from school or the occasional art piece they made from their classes, leaving heavy pangs in your chest. Sentimental as you are, you are reminded of the <i>happy times</i> when your sibling was more well-behaved. Obviously, there are many factors to familial happiness, but your parents were certainly happier when they did not have to scream at your sibling every thirty minutes. Before your sibling turned two, your family of course still had problems of its own - but that, you could contain. Or at least try to endure for one or two hours before the explosion came. The clock might as well have been doing a countdown.</p>
<p>But when your sibling decided it was high time they <i>pulled profanities out of their limited vocabulary</i>, all you could do is clasp your hands together, and pray that some invisible being above would just shut them up before your parents caught wind of the sentence. You would try to get them to be quiet, to tell them to stop talking, or you would try to distract them, but they would end up yelling at whoever was unlucky enough to be near their vicinity.</p>
<p>And of course, you would have to listen to whatever your Dad decided would be good enough a scolding to yell back at them. Unfortunately, there usually was no winning side to the shouting match, as you were too busy being scared out of your wits. Deep down, you feel a little ashamed, and perhaps embarrassed, to be near two people with steam coming out of their ears. You would wish you could bury yourself, or dig a tomb six feet underground, even though you were well aware of how tall you are, and the fact that you looked like you were Medusa'd did not help. Sometimes, you would very much like to tell your sibling to actually shut up, or to cover their mouth, but that would be rude.</p>
<p>Anything for the silence. The lack of sound does not mean peace, in fact it only acts as a miserable imitation. With the clock ominously reminding you of the time you have left, it takes grit to continue pretending, but stopping would only send you into a dazed panic. You did not know why you were so scared of time. At some point you figured it out for yourself, but your heart has a tendency to forget, especially with its present giddiness. As if you were in a trance, your body is suspended in freefall, midair, free yet pushed down by some invisible force. That was probably gravity trying to root you into reality, allowing you to be perfectly aware all the while floating away. But you were not even floating either. Lead bricks were pressing on your chest. No, it must have been pent-up air, pressure build-up.</p>
<br>
<p>"When you're finished, please lock the door and turn the lights off," said a soft voice behind you. It was from your Dad, a low sound that swirled the air with heaviness. Being there, cleaning the pile of old trinkets felt like being in a funeral.</p>
<p>Your Dad quietly shut the wooden door near you with a soft <i>slid</i>. You continued your cleaning job, half of you just wanting to throw the plastic globe model somewhere to free up some space. The thing was sickeningly large, and your sibling would not find use for it at least in the next three years. However, its size meant that it had to stay, sadly. Just like everything else. You decided not to throw anything, except for some plastic scraps dismissible as trash.</p>
<p>You silently turned to the blue roses, abandoned atop the counter. The blue colour of the paper flowers had already faded into a bleak, ashen green, although the paper still retained most of its shape. You could see where you gave up on making the flowers look nice - where the petals were left uncut and hastily curled outwards. You had never been good at time-consuming, long term projects. You had already forgotten what the flowers were for, so you just assume they were probably made for some friend of yours.</p>
<p>The reminiscence almost sent you into a literal whirlwind. It was scary how long time had passed. Scary how far you have already gone from the <i>happy times</i>, when life was still a more creamy and warm yellow colour. Now, it felt as if you were already an adult, although you clearly are not. You lack experience. You lack sufficient emotions and knowledge to grasp the grown up perspective. You tend to overestimate your abilities, everything felt so easy, tasteless, lifeless, gray, incomprehensible, not worth comprehending, <i>pointless</i> -  yet you still manage to disappoint yourself along the way. Hypostress, which ends with resentment. You are not calm enough, calculated enough, to plan everything <i>right</i>. The parts you have done wrong, the aspects of your world you could have fixed, they tasted like unfiltered coffee with grounds. Definitely not the way you usually like to drink the beverage.</p>
<p>You feel suspended, upside-down, spiraling, your head might very well be juggling itself. It was unpleasant to be reminded of how close the next school year is. School life, home life, <i>life</i> had always been a game of catching up, proving yourself. You do not dare to think what would happen if you let yourself drop behind the competition, be forgotten. People talk to you about the increasingly more competitive job market, and from their description you seem to already be there in spirit. On edge, in suspension, a tightrope walk. You seem to be holding your breath for absolutely forever, anticipation, any moment now. The possibility of being left behind felt too terrifying for you to comprehend, the possibility of being useless and a nuisance. The pressure that comes with trying not to disappoint brings bitterness to the mouth.</p>
<p>&#9734;&#24417;</p>
<p>Your hand tastelessly let go of the plastic container, with the roses. At some point, getting to the other end of the high rope feels meaningless. Your feet are already becoming numb with the constant walking. Your body constantly on edge, you wonder whether you should stop. Fall, it will be all right. You let your colours slip your fingers, it is pointless to chase after them. &#x2605;&#24417;</p>
<p>But there are people who are cheering to see you reach the other end. You do not want to disappoint. You can make ends meet, you <b>will</b> finish it. You have things to do, responsibilities, moral obligations. You cannot bear to let the spectators down, and so you grind your teeth, and move on. You focus on your task at hand, in case your emotions take over again and you make a false move that you end up regretting. Hyperstress, every moment you might burst, the pain dizzy and intoxicating - any reason to continue. You are a walking contradiction.</p>
<p>Scattered in the trash can lay the blue roses. Oh well, it should be 11:30 now. You should probably go find something else to do.</p>
