	<p>To approach vocabulary questions, identify the word form and verb form (if possible). The answer should reflect the tense of the verb if a verb is present. Contextualise all words to the passage. The question would usually have the word "mean" or "meaning".</p>
	<p>&#128161; Is the question asking something positive or negative? Focus on the connotations of both the question and the passage.</p>

There is a burgeoning (but not yet fully representative) array of fashion that does not subscribe to this model. Designers such as Bethany Williams embody fashion with integrity.

Beijing has refused to join the Mekong River Commission which was formed by four other nations.

This mirrors the concept of “pretty privilege” in society, where people who look a certain way get more opportunities and attention merely because of their appearance. On the other hand, kids who may not be considered conventionally attractive but possess other qualities like kindness, intelligence, or creativity are often ignored or undervalued in a society that places too much emphasis on outward appearances.”</p>

	<p style="margin-left:20px;line-height:15px">&#x2022; <b>Question Requirement (QR)</b>: What does the question want? → figurative</p>
	<p>2 mark questions are usually inference questions. Within this class of questions, there are several different subtypes:</p>
&#128161; To approach <b>tone questions</b>, do not focus on the synonyms during paraphrasing, but rather focus on descriptive words and adjectives.</p>
	<p>&#128161; To approach <b>LFI/ writer's style questions</b>, look at the purpose of the writer or their intended action. Thus, your answer should have a <b>verb</b> present.</p>

		<p style="font-size:16px">E.g. 1. “So, to my mind, there is little doubt that the next century is going to be a bumpy road as money and space become ever more scarce.

		<p style="font-size:16px">E.g. 2. “In the mid-20th century, sociologist Erving Goffman introduced the concept of a “total institution”. This sees inhabitants cut off from wider society under a single authority in an enclosed social space. Sociologists typically study prisons, asylums and other physical spaces as examples. <b>But I believe pet-keeping constitutes a sort of dispersed “total institution”. This is because non-human animals are unnaturally forced under human authority, restrained, and re-socialised.

But it is important to recognise that this is entirely manufactured (sometimes quite cruelly) by humans through behaviour “corrections” and the manipulative process of domestication itself. Ultimately, companion animals, by their very position in the social order, are not and cannot be equals. The institution of pet-keeping maintains a social hierarchy which privileges humans and positions all others as objects as lower importance. <b>Their right to existence depends wholly on their potential to benefit humans.</b>”</p>

One such bias is the “pretty privilege”, wherein people who fit into what society considers pretty enjoy unfair advantages.

		<p style="font-size:16px">E.g. 7. “Apart from the prices and accessibility, urban farming sees issues in its ‘fields’. Agriculture practices and urban growth have long been considered unhappy bedfellows, with arable land often sacrificed to build apartments and new roads. Similarly, since urban farming tends to be situated in most urban spaces, the perception that the spaces can be used for more economically productive activities has to be challenged alongside concerns regarding the commercial viability of such enterprises. This leads to another consideration involving the management of urban spaces and the optimal re-purposing of existing infrastructure to accommodate the growth of such farms. While farming near customers sounds sensible, to farm at scale efficiently means space is needed due to the large equipment needed for such exploits. <b>Yet</b>, one should not disregard the huge untapped areas in the centres of many cities, often abandoned and forgotten, that we could be using to make the food chain more resilient. One example is the Swiss aquaponics enterprise, Urban Farmers, which took over the derelict rooftop floors of De Schilde, a former Philips TV and phone set factory in The Hague. THrough its converted space, it aims to produce 45 tonnes of vegetables and 19 tonnes of tilapia annually. We need to envision the opportunities in such unusual urban spaces and invest in their development to see the growth of such farms.”</p>
