<h2>1. Eukaryotic Cell Ultrastructure</h2>
<h3>i. Cell Theory</h3>
<p>
+) The cell is the basic unit of life. It is the building block of each organism
that carries out all the essential processes of life that makes the organism a
living entity.
</p>
<p>
+) All organisms are made up of cells. Organisms composed of a single cell are
unicellular whereas those made up of many cells are multicellular.
</p>
<p>
+) All cells arise from pre-existing cells by division.
</p>
<p>
+) The cell contains information (hereditary materials/DNA) which is used as
instructions for growth, development and functioning.
</p>
<p>
+) The cell is the functional unit of life in which chemical reactions that
maintain life take place within it.
</p>
<h3>ii.  Cellular organisation</h3>
<p>
+) Eukaryotes (which means “true nucleus”): inclusive of all plants and animals,
the cell of a eukaryote possesses a true nucleus containing genetic materials
known as DNA, enclosed within the nuclear envelope.
</p>
<p>
+) Prokaryotes (which means “before the nucleus”): inclusive of bacteria and
archaea, the cell of a prokaryote lacks a true nucleus. The genetic material is
not enclosed within membranes but lies freely within the cytoplasm.
</p>
<h3>iii. Eukaryotic cells</h3>
<p>
+) Has at least 3 major structural features that make up its protoplasm (living
matter of the cell):
</p>
<ul>
<li>A cell surface membrane that forms a boundary between the internal and
external environment of the cell. It is partially permeable and controls
substances entering and leaving the cell.</li>
<li>A nucleus  that contains genetic materials (DNA) and directs cellular
activities.</li>
<li>The cytoplasm which contains the following:</li>
<li>Cytosol: a fluid component/aqueous solution of various essential ions,
soluble organic compounds such as sugars and amino acids, and soluble proteins,
many of which are enzymes.</li>
<li>Organelles: subcellular components which carry out specific functions to
maintain the cell or a multicellular organism. May or may not be membrane
bound.</li>
<li>Cytoskeleton: a network of fine strands of globular proteins. These support
the cell and maintain its overall shape.</li>
<li>In addition, plant cells have a rigid cell wall external to the cell surface
membrane.</li>
</ul>
<img src="Untitled design.png" width="100%" alt="cell_diagram" title="cell diagram">
</p>
<h3>iv. Membrane systems and organelles within cytoplasm</h3>
<p>
+) Compartmentalisation:  the cytoplasm is organised into compartments called
organelles. Organelles may or may not have a membrane. Each organelle has its
own function for the cell or the organism. Specific chemical reactions are
located within each organelle.

<h3>v. Protein synthesis</h3>
<p>
+) Genetic information from the nucleus directs the synthesis of particular
proteins using ribosomes.
</p>
<p>
+) For proteins that are to be secreted out of the cell (extracellular protein)
→ protein secretory pathway:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Ribosomes bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) synthesise the
polypeptide chain into the rER.</li>
<li>The protein becomes enclosed in an ER/ transport vesicle. The ER vesicle
containing the protein buds off from the ER.</li>
<li>The ER vesicle travels and fuses with the cis-face of the Golgi
apparatus.</li>
<li>The Golgi apparatus chemically modifies, sorts and transports the proteins.
The proteins move through the Golgi apparatus by Golgi vesicles budding off from
one cisterna and fusing with another.</li>
<li>The secretory vesicle containing the protein buds off from the trans-face of
the Golgi apparatus, travels and fuses with the cell surface membrane, thus
releasing the protein out of the cell.</li>
</ol>
<p>
+) For proteins that are needed for use within the cell → synthesised by free
ribosomes.
</p>
<p>
vi. Plant cells and animal cells
</p>
<p>
+) Similarities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Present in both cells is the protoplasm - cell surface membrane, nucleus,
and cytoplasm consisting of organelles, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,
mitochondria and ribosomes.</li>
<li>Chromosomes are composed of linear DNA wound around proteins</li>
</ul>

</table>
<p>
+) Care of the microscope:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Always use both hands when carrying: one hand on the arm and one hand under
the base for support. Carry it close to the body and always carry in an upright
position.</li>
<li>Do not tilt the microscope forward as the eyepiece might fall off</li>
<li>When placing the microscope on a table, keep it away from the edge.</li>
<li>Do not touch the lens surface with finger as the small amount of oil on the
surface of the skin will leave a film on the glass.</li>
<li>When unpacking the microscope, make sure:</li>
<li>The 4X objective lens is aligned to the round glass of the stage</li>
<li>The stage is at the highest position</li>
<li>After all the steps above, uncoil the electrical wires.</li>
<li>Never clean exposed eyepiece, objective lens or condenser lens with anything
other than lens paper as the magnifying lens are easily scratched.</li>
<li>Wipe off any moisture that may get on or into the stage or moving parts of
the microscope.</li>
<li>When packing the microscope, make sure to:</li>
<li>Adjust the 4X objective lens is aligned to the round glass of the stage</li>
<li>Adjust the stage is at the highest position</li>
<li>Coil the electrical wires</li>
<li>Finally, lower the stage to lowest point.</li>
</ul>
<p>
+) Step by step guide on using a microscope:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug in the microscope - excess wire must not dangle over the edge of the
table. Switch on the microscope (switch is at the bottom right).</li>
<li>Position 4X objective lends to be facing the stage opening/ hole. Turn
nosepiece to move objective lens in place. (Must start with 4X objective lens
before moving on.)</li>
<li>Place the slide on the microscope stage with the specimen directly over the
stage opening/ hole. Clip the slide in place and move the slide accordingly
using the stage control knob.</li>
<li>Focus using the coarse adjustment knob. Turn the knob to raise the stage to
the highest position. Position eye at the eyepiece, and while looking into the
eyepiece, slowly lower stage with coarse adjustment knob. The specimen should
appear in the field of  view and a sharp image is obtained.
<p>
    Note: field of view is the diameter of the circle of light that can be seen
when looking through the eyepiece.
</p>
<p>
    Adjust the distance between the 2 eyepieces so both eyes can see one
complete field of view at the same time. Slowly move on to the 10X, 40X, 60X
objective lens and adjust accordingly.
